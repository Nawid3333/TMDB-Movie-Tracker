    Creates a backup before writing to prevent data loss on corruption.
    `os.replace` makes the directory-entry swap atomic, but it does not

    rename can land while the data is still sitting in the page cache,
    leaving a file that atomically points at nothing useful. The

    this project (index, details, session, collection cache, keyword TV
    cache, gaps, enrichment checkpoint) so the durability behaviour can't
    drift between call sites.

    A unique mkstemp() name (rather than a fixed "<file>.tmp") avoids
    collisions if two runs ever write the same file concurrently, and the
    except-branch cleanup means a failed write never leaves an orphaned
    temp file behind.
